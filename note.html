Hello everybody!

In this page you'll find some notes I took during my studies at the University of Padova, more precisely:
<ul>
  <li>Notes from courses of the second and third year of the <b>Bachelor in Physics</b> (in <i>italian</i>, A.A. 2015/16).</li>
  <li>Notes from courses of the Master in <b>Physics of Data</b> (in <i>english</i>, Academic Year 2019/20)</li>
</ul>
You can **download** notes in `pdf` format from Google Drive (I'm considering moving only to GitHub, but we'll see), by clicking on the icon
<img src="/assets/images/icon1.png" style="width: 16px;"/>. More recent notes are written in Latex, and are uploaded as soon as possible (sometimes
 directly after the lecture). For the **fastest updates**, please refer to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Einlar/data_notes). If you want to know which kind of sorcery is needed to write in Latex during lectures, please visit this [https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/](link), or ask
 me (I personally use a quite different setup, and I'm forever trying to improve it).

 I'll try my best to revise notes and upload corrections with a delay of about 1-2 week from the lecture's date - I will signal it there, so 
 please re-download notes after some time.

Finally, please be warned that there may be errors and missing stuff (even entire lectures), especially for older lectures.<br/>
In any case, if you find something wrong or missing please tell me (mail `francesco.manzali@studenti.unipd.it`). Contact me also if you want to 
collaborate on note-taking or exercises, or even if you have something to share!
